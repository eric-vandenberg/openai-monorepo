<p align="center"><strong>studio-monorepo</strong> is a production grade monorepo ready to be scaled and distributed. Authentication is handled through JWT cookies from browser clients and through RPC calls between microservices on the same machine (locally) or within the same network namespace (kubernetes cluster).</p>

<br />

<p align="center">This example provides business logic and data persistence for a potential app client to assist content creators in generating beat sheets as outlines to help guide new projects. OpenAI integration was added to help these creators discover new paths and possibilities in their creation process.</p>

He pursues a phantom version of his lost lover through a crowd, tries to hold onto a fading hand in an ethereal white space.\n\nAct 4: At this point, we get a flashback sequence showing the happier times in their relationship - passionate kisses, laughter, shared dreams."
